    "# OpenFEMA API Tutorial: Part 1 - Getting Started \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Quick Summary\n",
    "- This is an introduction to the OpenFEMA API and will demonstrate its basic use - *it is not a Python language tutorial*\n",
    "- A web API allows users to send a request to a web-based resource that sends a response back containing data\n",
    "- The OpenFEMA API has a rich set of features that allow data to be filtered, sorted, and integrated into your own apps or automations\n",
    "- Calling the API can be done easily through a web browser or through code\n",
    "- Metadata can be returned with each dataset call\n",
    "- The [Final Working Example](#Final-Working-Example) consists of Python code that will perform the basics - declare a library to facilitate web requests, specify the endpoint URL, issue the OpenFEMA API call, and capture the results\n",
    "- The next tutorial will cover OpenFEMA API parameters and additional usage examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "FEMA collects vast amounts of data on multiple aspects of emergency management—Disaster Information, Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), Emergency Management, Preparedness, and Grants. OpenFEMA is the public’s resource for this raw data. Datasets are available for download, along with an application programming interface (API) that provides data in an easily digestible, machine-readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to provide an introduction to the OpenFEMA API and demonstrate its basic use. If you are new to OpenFEMA, are new to APIs, or have limited programming experience, start here. The examples are presented using Python 3, but it should be easy to translate them to almost any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed explanation of the OpenFEMA program and the datasets it offers, please see the [OpenFEMA webpage](https://www.fema.gov/open).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API?\n",
    "Put simply, an application programming interface is software that sends information back and forth between a resource or application and users. A *web API* indicates that the information travels across the internet. Users send requests, the resource (a computer/server) interprets the request, and sends a response. The response could be a chunk of data or a message (e.g., \"bad request\" or \"I did what you asked successfully\"). The \"user\" does not have to be a person. An app or website utilize an API. Data analysis tools can often use API's directly as data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "![API Depiction](img/api_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "### Why would I want to use the OpenFEMA API rather than download the full dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenFEMA offers full files for all its datasets. If you are doing some kind of study or visualization that requires the full set of data, downloading the full file is definitely the way to go. See the [OpenFEMA Developer Resources](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/developer-resources) webpage for other examples of downloading. However, the API offers several advantages over the full file in some situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easier to incorporate into your own applications or automated scripts.\n",
    "- The ability to filter data. \n",
    "  - Selecting only the records you need can result in a faster download - especially for some of the larger OpenFEMA datasets.\n",
    "  - Retrieving only updates to a previously downloaded dataset.\n",
    "  - Some datasets, such as FIMA NFIP Policies, are so large that analysis cannot occur within a spreadsheet. Either a database or a programming language would be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ability to shape the data by selecting specific fields for which to return, sorting data, and limiting returned records.\n",
    "  - Can result in faster downloads as there is less data.\n",
    "  - Reduce cleanup work in your code/analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Terminology\n",
    "You may come across the following terms in either the OpenFEMA documentation, responses from the OpenFEMA mailbox, or other API related documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API Call** - The process of sending a request to an API endpoint. The endpoint will respond by sending feedback - either the data you requested or some other message.\n",
    "- **API Endpoint** - Technically, the end of a communication channel. For OpenFEMA, this refers to the function name that will return data. For example, DataDeclarationsSummaries is an endpoint.\n",
    "- **Base URL Path** - A web address or location where the endpoints reside. For OpenFEMA, this value is ```https://www.fema.gov/api/open```. This needs to be a part of the API call and is in the following format: ```base url path/version/endpoint name```. \n",
    "- **Cache** - A software or hardware mechanism that stores data so users can access or retrieve data faster. OpenFEMA uses a \"content delivery network\" to cache files and API requests. Additionally, your browser may cache the results of your API calls. Sometimes the cache must be cleared to reflect updated data.\n",
    "- **CSV (comma-separated value)** - A tabular data format easy for humans to read and write. Can be viewed using spreadsheet tools.\n",
    "- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** - A data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for computers to parse and generate. Most programming languages support this format. This is the OpenFEMA default format.\n",
    "- **Parameters** - Variables used in computer programming and API queries to pass information to a function or endpoint. The OpenFEMA API offers many parameters to retrieve information.\n",
    "- **Version** - When a new or existing endpoint is created or modified, it is assigned a version. Rather than overwrite an existing endpoint that may break a user's process, both versions are maintained and available for a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calling an OpenFEMA Endpoint\n",
    "First you need to find an endpoint. The [OpenFEMA DataSets](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets) page acts as a jumping off point to find a dataset for which you are interested. Clicking on any of the dataset version links will take you to a dataset description page (e.g., [Disaster Declarations Summaries - v2](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/disaster-declarations-summaries-v2). As illustrated below, the table at the top of the page defines the API endpoint among other useful dataset attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample Dataset Header](img/dataset_header.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### From A Browser\n",
    "Simply entering the base URL path with the version and endpoint name in a web browser URL bar will issue the call and data will be returned: https://www.fema.gov/api/open/v2/DisasterDeclarationsSummaries\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    <b>Tip:</b> OpenFEMA returns data by default in a JSON format. If you use the FireFox browser, the JSON return will be displayed in a very readable, hierarchical format. Other browsers will display the raw return and will require an extension or plug-in to display it in a more human-readable format. Although the data is returned in a human-readable format in a web browser, it it not possible to work with/perform analysis on the data without the use of other tools. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Code\n",
    "While the examples presented here are in Python 3, they can be easily transferable to other programming languages. The process is straightforward - declare a library or module that can facilitate requests to web resources, define the URL/API endpoint, issue the API call, and capture the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    <b>Tip:</b> If you are brand new to computer programming, getting started can be confusing. Normally a developer will have installed Python language tools and an intrepreter and use an interactive developer environment (IDE) to write and execute code. Installing Anaconda (or some other tool that offers Jupyter notebook capability along with the Python language) is an easy way to begin. See the Super Simple Python Tutorial for Beginners at the bottom of this notebook for a basic introduction to Python programming.  \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    <b>Note:</b> The following example uses Python's built-in, standard urllib module to issue the request. There are many other modules that offer the same capability: urllib2, urllib3, requests. Urllib is used for its simplicity and so that this code aligns with our other code examples. The alternative libraries are more robust.\n",
